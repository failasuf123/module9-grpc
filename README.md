## Reflection

1. What are the key differences between unary, server streaming, and bi-directional streaming RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods, and in what scenarios would each be most suitable?

    **Jawab**


2. What are the potential security considerations involved in implementing a gRPC service in Rust, particularly regarding authentication, authorization, and data encryption?

    **Jawab**


3. What are the potential challenges or issues that may arise when handling bidirectional streaming in Rust gRPC, especially in scenarios like chat applications?

    **Jawab**


4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream for streaming responses in Rust gRPC services?

    **Jawab**


5. In what ways could the Rust gRPC code be structured to facilitate code reuse and modularity, promoting maintainability and extensibility over time?

    **Jawab**



6. In the MyPaymentService implementation, what additional steps might be necessary to handle more complex payment processing logic?

    **Jawab**


7. What impact does the adoption of gRPC as a communication protocol have on the overall architecture and design of distributed systems, particularly in terms of interoperability with other technologies and platforms?

    **Jawab**


8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using HTTP/2, the underlying protocol for gRPC, compared to HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.1 with WebSocket for REST APIs?

    **Jawab**


9. How does the request-response model of REST APIs contrast with the bidirectional streaming capabilities of gRPC in terms of real-time communication and responsiveness?

    **Jawab**


10. What are the implications of the schema-based approach of gRPC, using Protocol Buffers, compared to the more flexible, schema-less nature of JSON in REST API payloads?

    **Jawab**
